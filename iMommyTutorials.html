        <p> Do your laundry once a week! Underwear, camisoles, and socks should be washed after each wear. Bras can be worn twice before washing. Other garments, unless specified, should be washed based on activity. For example, a tshirt worn during jogging should be washed after one wear due to sweat. Spot clean stains with soap, and if necessary, a little bleach as soon as possible.
