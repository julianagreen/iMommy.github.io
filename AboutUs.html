        <p> Hi! We are girls from the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program 2016 at Adobe San Francisco. Our mission in creating iMommy is to fill in for mom when she are unavailable, cut mom's work load, and ease mom's worries. Our virtual iMommy allows momsto be right in your pocket, ready to help you overcome any challenges of adulthood. Most importantly, iMommy reciprocates all the love and respect of our affectionate, caring, and devoted mothers.
